I found 2 interesting colcusions from the calulations. The first was that larger schools have signficantly lower reading and math scores compared to small and medium schools.
One readon for this could be that smaller schools are more likely to be private school.
The scecond conclusion that I found that as the spending increases per student, thhe school's scores tend to decrease.
I am not sure why this is the case. This is a correlation and not a causation.
